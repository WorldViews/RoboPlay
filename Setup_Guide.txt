Setup for MS mode

Slave
Roscore
Plug in the robot’s cablesudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0                            (for permission)roslaunch phantomx_rst arm.launch                          (for set up the robot)
Master
Plug in the robot’s cable
sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0                        (for permission)roslaunch phantomx_rst master_arm.launch                        (for set up the robot)roslaunch two_robot_control two_robot_control.launch                 (to start sending the joint angles)

Go back to Slave
roslaunch output ms_output.launch             (to start receiving the joint angles and move the robot)

If you start “roslaunch output ms_output.launch” without starting “roslaunch two_robot_control two_robot_control.launch”, the robot arm goes to the initial position, so the robot arm may contact with some obstacles and may be broken.
